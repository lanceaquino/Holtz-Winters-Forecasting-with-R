# Holtz-Winters-Forecasting-with-R # 

## Description ## 
Holt-Winters Forecasting (HWF) method, also known as, triple exponential smoothing, uses a more complicated approach compared to moving averages, trend forecast and Centered Moving Average (CMA). 

For this small project, I used HWF for forecasting Amazon's quarterly financial data. HWF was used to account for the seasonal variations of the data.
